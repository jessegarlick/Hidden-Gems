# Hidden Gems
Hidden Gems is a social web application for discovering and sharing under-the-radar locations. Users post "Gems"—spots 
they find unique or hidden—complete with ratings on enjoyment and crowd level, powered by Google Maps and AWS-SDK for 
precise mapping and efficient data handling. It's also a platform for connection, allowing users to follow others, 
personalize their profiles with images and custom themes, and navigate a community-curated world of lesser-known locales.
